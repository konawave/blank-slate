# horiseon-refactor

## Description
* This refactor is to consolidate any excess elements/selectors, as well as improve accessibility through more clear image alt texts, class/id titles, and semantic HTML elements. 

* I reduced all of the benefits class varients to a single .benefits, and I removed multiple unnecessary class attributes that repeated the element. 

## What I Learned
* I had some challenges correctly consolidating the selectors in CSS, and I found it difficult to give concise and helpful alt texts for some of the images.

## Howto
* To use the website, navigate to the respective URL and use the 3 directory options in the top right area of the screen to navigate to its related information.
